```
Why it is built this way: single-file site + service worker for offline use;
engine is a git submodule so every language ships the same drills and QA
tooling; word ids are frozen (`tools/id_map_v1.json`, since 2026-09-24) so a
rebuild never invalidates a learner's saved progress.

## Commands (pinned)
- Rebuild pack: `python3 tools/build_pack.py` (venv with `tools/requirements.txt`;
  set `PACKBUILDER_PATH=../vocab-engine/tools` to build against a non-submodule checkout)
- Regenerate JS from JSON: `python3 engine/tools/jsonify_pack.py pack`
- Build site: `./build.sh`
- Check (must pass before every commit of index.html): `./check.sh`
- Passages: `PYTHONPATH=engine/tools python3 -m packbuilder passages .`
- QA helpers: `PYTHONPATH=engine/tools python3 -m packbuilder {scan,sample} --lang es --repo .`
- Engine tests live in vocab-engine (see its CLAUDE.md)

## Always
- Commit index.html and sw.js together; check.sh's stale-build guard runs post-commit.
- Bump the engine submodule only to a vocab-engine main sha; rebuild after every bump.
- Keep ids append-only; never renumber (tools/id_map_v1.json, frozen 2026-09-24).
- Path-limited commits: engine, index.html, sw.js, pack/, tools/, README.md, TODO.md; never .venv or .cache.
- Regenerate pack/*.js (jsonify_pack.py) any time pack/*.json changes, including passages.json.
- Use es-ES for TTS/STT (not es-MX/es-419).

## Never
- Edit pack/*.json by hand; change tools/gloss_overrides.json, tools/forced_a1.txt
  or tools/passages_src.json and rebuild instead.
- Edit pack/*.js, index.html or sw.js by hand (generated).
- Delete sw.js (use engine/engine/sw.disable.js).
- Add comments that say what the code does; only why, or an external reference.
- Push to main without `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD`.

## Generated files
pack/*.js, index.html, sw.js, tools/REPORT.md, tools/REPORT_passages.md,
tools/id_map_v1.json (frozen, hand-edit never), pack/passages.json (from
tools/passages_src.json via `packbuilder passages`).

## Where things are
README.md (end users), tools/README.md (builder inputs, file by file),
TODO.md (residuals + STATUS history), engine/ (submodule, read-only here).
